# Helium

Helium is a floating browser window that allows you to watch media, browse the
web and do much more while you stay productive. Your content will never fall
behind your other windows even as you switch tasks. Helium supports a
customizable translucency mode that allows you to simultaneously see your
content and your work, without intercepting mouse clicks when it's translucent.
You have the ability to click, drag, scroll behind your floating content.
